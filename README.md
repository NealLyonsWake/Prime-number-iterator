# Prime Number Calculator and Iterator

This is a basic console app I made as part of my self-study.

## How does it work?

When running in the console, the user is prompted to enter a positve integer value. The app will confirm if the user has entered a prime number. If the user has entered a prime number then the app will iterate through every prime number up to the prime number value provided by the user, and print it to the console. The app will inform the user if they have entered a composite number.

## Are there any plans to refactor the code?

Possibly; if I have the time available from my other projects, I would like to fortify DRY aspects of the code. Currently, there are a few lines that are similar that could potentially be modularised into seperate functions to make the code more manageable in future.
